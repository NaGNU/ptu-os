NaGNU Common License v2.0 “Velvetgrace”
(For folks who love sharing, not hiding code under the carpet)

1. Introduction
Hey there! If you’re reading this, you wanna use our software. Cool! But let’s keep it fair, like in 9th-grade law class when the teacher gave you a 10 for sneak-peeking at your neighbor’s test (just kidding!). Rules are simple: take, tweak, share—but don’t be greedy.

2. Your Rights (kinda like the Constitution, but easier):

    Copy as much as you want. A thousand USB sticks? A cloud full? Go nuts.

    See how it works. Source code is yours, like an open diary after graduation.

    Change the code however you like. Add pink ponies or a dark mode—your call.

    Share with everyone. Friends, enemies, your grandma in the village—free or for cookies.

3. Your Duties (don’t panic, it’s short):

    If you share a modified version—keep the code open. Like in the cafeteria: took a juice—return the cup. Hide the code? License is canceled, and we’ll be sad.

    Don’t add extra rules. No “pay $100” or “only for blondes.” Freedom is for everyone!

    Keep this license. Even if your project is now about AI for cats.

4. Warranty (or lack of it):
This software might crash, delete your homework, or summon aliens. We aren’t responsible for anything. Use it? Then you agree it’s your fault (kidding… maybe).

5. How to Add This License to Your Project:
Just put in README something like:
“This app is protected by NaGNU v2.0. Wanna copy it? Read the license, or else there might be a secret clause about Martians!”

6. If You Break the Rules:
All your rights vanish, like BBQ without skewers. You’ll have to apologize to the community and sing the NaGNU anthem (we’re still working on the lyrics!).

P.S. This license was written by someone who thought “copyleft” was the left Ctrl key. Found mistakes? Tell us—we’ll fix them at the next Open Source fan meetup!

Freedom, Brotherhood, Code!
